# 1. Installation

You may visit this page (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) on Visual Studio Code’s website for a tutorial on installing python for any operating system. Here we provide a concise version.

# 2. Using Google Collab

Visit (https://colab.research.google.com/) to get started.

Colab, or "Colaboratory", allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with

- Zero configuration required
- Access to GPUs free of charge
- Easy sharing

Whether you're a **student**, a **data scientist** or an **AI researcher**, Colab can make your work easier. Watch [Introduction to Colab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) to learn more, or just get started below!
